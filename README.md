# text-to-pdf
### A one file C program to help you convert a txt file to pdf.

### __What does it do ?__
- As you might have guessed it, given a filepath as input, it generates the necessary code to convert it to a PDF file.

### __Requirements__
- Obviously, a C compiler. I tested the program with both gcc (version 11.3) and clang, but really any decent C compiler should be ok running this. It only requires C89 functions, so I'd hope you don't use an older version.


### __How to install it on your computer ?__

```ps
git clone https://github.com/Esteban795/text-to-pdf.git
```
or whatever you want. Download it directly from Github if you'd prefer so.
<br/>
- From there, you can just run (in the right directory of course) : 
```ps
make build
```
and then, use the program as you wish :
